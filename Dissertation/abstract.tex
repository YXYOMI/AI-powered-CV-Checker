In recent years, e-recruitment systems have been augmented, and the mode of uploading resumes online to apply for positions has been popularized. In this situation, checking the resume automatically can fit the e-recruitment mode and help job seekers modify their CVs to match the target position better. There have been several powerful CV checkers such as CareerSet, which can provide comprehensive feedback on the resume. However, the inside techniques of the CV checkers are not open-sourced because of the business secrete. Therefore, this project aims to research and experiment with suitable NLP techniques and machine learning algorithms to create an AI-powered CV checker achieving the functionalities of existing CV checkers. More specifically, the project focuses on the techniques for information identification from resumes, skill extraction and text matching. Based on research and experiments, the Named Entity Recognition (NER) model is utilized to identify essential information in the resume, and cosine similarity is applied to compute text matching rate. As for skill extraction, a hybrid approach which combines POS tagging, regex chunking and a deep learning model with BERT layer together is implemented and improved. With these suitable approaches, the application allows users to upload the resume and job description, and returns feedback on content checking and skill matching.
